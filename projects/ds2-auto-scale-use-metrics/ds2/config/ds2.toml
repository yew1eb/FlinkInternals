##### DS2 configuration settings #####
##########################################
# This configuration file is used to manage the behavior of DS2

[system]
# Id of the streaming dataflow system that is being controlled by DS2.
# E.g. "Flink", "Heron", "Timely"
#
id = "Flink"

[paths]
# Path to the file containing the initial physical dataflow (required).
# See: examples/topology/

# Directory of the metrics repository containing rate files (required).
# DS2 expects one rate file per policy interval (epoch) with the following
# naming convention: 'rates-epoch_number.log'
# See: examples/metrics_repo/
#
#metrics_repo = "examples/metrics_repo/"

# Path to the CSV file containing the external source rates.
# These are the true rates of all data sources as measured
# outside the streaming system (required).
# See: examples/source_rates/
#

# Path to the system-specific bash script that is responsible
# for applying the new configuration (required).
# See: examples/system_scripts/

# and the scaling policy is invoked (required).

#
warm_up_time = 2

# Target rate ratio threshold (>= 1) defines the maximum allowed ratio
# of a target source rate to the respective observed source rate
# after a re-configuration. When DS2 converges and the aforementioned
# ratio for a source operator is above the specified threshold,
# a final configuration adjustment is triggered in an attempt
# to meet the required throughput (default value: f64::MAX)
#

# dataflow operator by factor * 100% more instances than the optimal (default value: 0).
